# Terminology

## Personal Shorthand
- ASW: Arduino software

## Arduino miscellany
- sketch: an Arduino program

## Serial connection

[Reference](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication)
 - rx: receiver
 - tx: transmitter

## Serial terminal

[Reference](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/all)

"you cannot issue command line statements within a terminal window"

- baud rate: how fast your data is being transmitted and received (9600 bits per second is standard)
- com/serial port: "Your device will show up on your computer as either COM# (if you‚Äôre on a Windows machine) or /dev/tty.usbserial-######## (if you‚Äôre on a Mac/Linux computer), where the #‚Äôs are unique numbers or alphabetic characters."

"within the Arduino environment, [the serial terminal] is called the Serial Monitor"

The Serial Monitor is opened by clicking the little magnifying glass-looking thing in the upper right of the Arduino software UI OR pressing [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[M].
If nothing is connected, clicking that icon or using the keyboard shortcut yields:
`Board at null is not available`

# Methodology

## Making a connection

Plugging the Arduino into a USB port makes it to where, after a few seconds, another port option that ends in (Arduino Uno) will pop up in the Tools -> Port dropdown menu in the Arduino Software (ASW).

Upoading a program to the Arduino makes the L LED flicker.

Every Arduino sketch must have a `setup` function and a separate `loop` function. the `setup` function runs **once**, when the Arduino initially receives power, after a reset, or after a sketch is uploaded. Conversely, the `loop` function loops. üëç

### LED Function

`HIGH` setting means high voltage/on/1.

`LOW` setting means low volates/off/0.
